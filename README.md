# Thesis

The three uploaded notebooks contain the code that I have created for my thesis research.
As three types of facial data have been used, three separate files have been uploaded. 
One of them includes EDA, predictions with personality traits data and predictions with OpenFace data:

1. OpenFace predictions (this notebook also contains Exploratory Data Analysis and Personality traits predictions).
2. LGBP-TOP predictions
3. VGG predictions

Enjoy my analyses,

Marie-Claire
