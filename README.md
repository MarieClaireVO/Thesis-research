# Thesis

The three uploaded notebooks contain the code that I have created for my thesis research.
As three types of facial data have been used, three separate files have been uploaded:

1. OpenFace predictions (this notebook also contains Exploratory Data Analysis and discarded predictions with the First Impressions personality traits).
2. LGBP-TOP predictions
3. VGG predictions

I hope you enjoy my analyses!
